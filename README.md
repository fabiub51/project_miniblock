## How to get started 
- First, once you cloned the repo, store all BIDS-formatted data in the "new_data" folder. This way, you can run the run_fmriprep.txt file in bash using docker.
- Secondly, after running fMRIPrep, you can start analyzing the data in the main script. Just make sure that you set up glmsingle somewhere on your machine.
